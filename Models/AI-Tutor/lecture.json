However, it often falls short in addressing data governance effectively. This is because the 3-layer architecture doesn't account for the different roles and responsibilities of various teams involved in the data lifecycle. This lecture introduces a 4-layer medallion architecture that addresses these shortcomings by explicitly defining the roles and responsibilities of each layer.", "title": "Introduction to the 4-Layer Medallion Architecture"}, {"key_points": ["Bronze layer captures data as-is from source systems.", "Data is stored in formats like Parquet or JSON.", "Schema is the same as the source system.", "Bronze layer is where data is first ingested into the data platform."], "lecture_notes": "The bronze layer is the first step in the data journey. It serves as a raw data repository, capturing data directly from source systems without any transformations or schema modifications. This layer is essentially a lossless replication of the source data. The data is typically stored in formats like Parquet or JSON, which are efficient for cloud storage and processing. The schema of the bronze layer mirrors the source system, providing a consistent representation of the original data.", "title": "The Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion"}, {"key_points": ["Silver layer cleans, transforms, and structures data.", "Data is made ready for self-service analytics.", "Data is aligned to the source system.", "Governance responsibility lies with the source team."], "lecture_notes": "The silver layer focuses on data quality and preparation. Data from the bronze layer is cleansed, transformed, and structured to meet the requirements of self-service analytics. This layer defines the data model and ensures that the data is consistent with the source system. The governance of the silver layer is the responsibility of the source team, which ensures that the data remains aligned with the source system and that changes to the source system are reflected in the silver layer.", "title": "The Silver Layer: Data Cleansing and Transformation"}, {"key_points": ["Platinum layer creates data marts for specific business needs.", "Data is tailored to the requirements of functional teams.", "Data models are designed to meet the specific needs of the functional team.", "Governance is limited to the functional area."], "lecture_notes": "The platinum layer is where data is tailored to meet the specific needs of functional teams.
